Introduction :
Developed in 2001, the agile software development methodologies were based on the 
most revered agile manifesto that laid down the principles and core practices. Before 
.understanding the agile methodologies definition, it is pertinent to know what agile is
Agile is a set of techniques followed by a team to administer a project or plan by dividing it 
into various stages with continuous collaboration with customers. There is constant 
monitoring at every phase of the software development of the project. The agile 
methodology advantages are that both the development plus testing actions are parallel 
 .and synchronized, unlike the conventional waterfall methodology
The definition of AgileMethodology
The agile methodology is one of the most straightforward ways to turn a concept and 
various requirements into workable software solutions. The Agile methodology is an 
iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes continuous 
planning, understanding, updating, team collaboration, development, and delivery. The 
agile method is broken down into individual teams’ models, allowing for more adaptability 
 .to changes
The agile process begins with customers specifying the end uses of the final product and 
the types of problems the final product seeks to solve. It is guided by the ideals of giving 
value and engaging with stakeholders. This activity aids the project development team 
.address and clarifying the customer’s expectations and requirements
The selected teams prepare and work on a comprehensive process that includes planning, 
implementation, and evaluation as soon as the project begins. Errors are resolved at the 
project’s intermediate stage because the development process is iterative. This method 
 .allows the final supplied product to better match the customer’s needs
Important Types Of Agile Methodology 6
There are various types of agile methodology available in the market to suit every project’s 
wants. Although there are different agile methodologies, everything is based on the main 
.principles in the agile manifesto
Therefore, every framework or behavior that adapts these principles is named Agile, and, 
notwithstanding the different types of agile methodologies a team implements, the agile 
methodology benefits can be copiously apprehended only with the collaboration of all the 
 .involved parties
The below agile methodologies list comprises of famous types of agile methodology that 
 :one can opt from
Kanban )1
Originating from the Japanese language, the translation of the word ‘Kanban’ is “visual 
board or signboard” and is connected to the concept of “just in time”! Initially, the Kanban 
concept was introduced as a lean manufacturing system and slowly drove its way to agile 
software development teams. This method uses visual methods for developing and 
 .managing projects
Projects through Kanban are overseen with the help of the Kanban Board, which is divided 
into columns to depict the process flow of the software development. This helps in 
increasing visibility teams as the teams can see the progress through every stage of 
!”development and prepare for the upcoming tasks to deliver the product “just in time
This method requires thorough interaction and transparency to enable the team members 
to be equipped with the right stage of the development at any time and have a cohesive 
.flow of work at all times
Scrum )2
One of the most popular agile methodology examples is the agile scrum development 
methodology, which is depicted by various cycles of development. Similar to Kanban, 
Scrum breaks down the development phases into stages or cycles called ‘sprints’. The 
development time for each sprint is maximized and dedicated, thereby managing only one 
 .sprint at a time
Scrum and agile methodologies focus on continuous deliverables, and thus this method lets 
designers adjust priorities to ensure that any incomplete or overdue sprints get more 
 .attention
Scrum Team has exclusive project roles such as a scrum master and a product owner with 
constant communications on the daily scrum where the activities are harmonized to devise 
 .the best way to implement the sprint
Extreme Programming (XP) )3
Extreme Programming (XP) is a methodology that emphasizes teamwork, communication, 
and feedback. It focuses on constant development and customer satisfaction. Similar to 
scrum, this method also uses sprints or short development cycles. This is developed by a 
 .team to create a productive and highly efficient environment
Extreme Programming technique is very supportive in a situation of constant and varying 
demands from the customers. It motivates the developers to accept changes in the 
customer’s demands, even if they pop-up in an advanced phase of the development 
 .process
In Extreme Programming, the project is tested from the initial stages by collecting 
feedback that progresses the output of the system. This also presents a spot check to 
.implement easily any customer requirements
Crystal )4
Introduced by Mr. Alistair Cockburn, one of the monumental persons in formulating the 
Agile manifesto for software development, Crystal is a group of smaller agile development 
methodologies comprising of Crystal Yellow, Crystal Clear, Crystal Red, Crystal Orange, and 
more. Each has its peculiar and exclusive framework that is characterized by factors such 
as system criticality, team size, and project priorities. Depending on the nature of the 
project or system criticality such as Comfort (C), Essential Money (E), Discretionary Money 
 .(D), and Life (L), the kind of crystal agile methodology is chosen
Similar to other methodologies of Agile, Crystal also addresses prompt delivery of 
software, regularity, less administration with high involvement of users, and customer 
satisfaction. The Crystal family advocates that each system or project is inimitable and 
necessitates the solicitation of diverse practices, processes, and policies to achieve the best 
results, earning the name of the most lightweight methods of agile methodology
Feature Driven Development (FDD)
Feature Driven Development (FDD) was first introduced in 1997 by Jeff De Luca when he 
worked on an application development project for the largest Singapore bank. FDD is an 
incremental process for software development and is a method of agile development to 
develop software. FDD integrates a variety of widely-respected best practices into an 
integrated whole. These practices are guided by the client-valued functional (feature) 
standpoint. The primary purpose of FDD is to provide real-time, functional software 
quickly. The benefit of FDD is that it can scale for large teams thanks to the idea of ‘just 
enough design initially’ (JEDI). Thanks to its feature-centric design process, it’s a fantastic 
method to control rapid, incremental, and complex projects. It is comprised of five 
 :fundamental tasks
Development of an overall model 
Building of a feature list 
Planning by feature 
Designing by feature 
.Building by feature 
Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) )6
To address the need for a standard industry charter for the swift delivery of software, the 
Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) was developed. DSDM gives a 
comprehensive structure that is defined and modified to create a plan, execute, manage, 
and scale the procedure of software development. Based on a business-driven approach 
and eight principles, the DSDM believes that modifications to the project are always 
.expected, and quality with timely delivery must never be negotiated
Conclusion
A dynamic approach is required in choosing the right agile methodology among the 
different types of agile methodology. The advantages and disadvantages of agile 
methodology must always be considered to choose the framework for one’s business to 
entice talent and convey remarkable digital experiences in this aggressively competitive 
.market
